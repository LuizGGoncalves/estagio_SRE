# Log Analyzer
This is a Ruby on Rails application that reads a log file containing logs in the following format:

  ```json
  {
    "env": "prod",
    "path": "/path1",
    "method": "PUT",
    "duration": "154",
    "statusCode": "594",
    "statusMessage": "status message 2",
    "host": "queroteste.com",
    "level": "LEVEL 2",
    "message": "message 1",
    "timestamp": "1679339588.550617"
  }
  ```
  The application processes the information and delivers a JSON where it is possible to view the path where the request was made and the number of successes and failures.
